This error is reported in Java, and in C, C++, and Objective-C code that uses
pthread mutexes or the C++ standard library mutexes. A deadlock occurs when two
distinct threads try to acquire the same two distinct lock objects in reverse
orders. The following code illustrates a textbook example. Of course, in real
deadlocks, the lock acquisitions may be separated by deeply nested call chains.

```java
  public void lockAThenB() {
    synchronized(lockA) {
      synchronized(lockB) {
       // do something with both resources
      }
    }
  }

  public void lockBThenA() {
    synchronized(lockB) {
      synchronized(lockA) {
       // do something with both resources
      }
    }
  }
```

Here, `lockA` and `lockB` refer to the same objects in both methods. Acquiring
unrelated lock objects in the two threads does not form this cycle.

The standard solution to a deadlock is to fix an order of lock acquisition and
adhere to that order in all cases. Another solution may be to shrink the
critical sections (i.e., the code executing under lock) to the minimum required.

Old-style containers such as `Vector` are synchronized on the object monitor,
which means that deadlocks can occur even without explicit synchronisation on
both threads. For instance:

```java
  public void lockAThenAddToVector() {
    synchronized(lockA) {
      vector.add(object);
    }
  }

  public void lockVectorThenA() {
    synchronized(vector) {
      synchronized(lockA) {
       // do something with both resources
      }
    }
  }
```

Infer has support for detecting these deadlocks too.

To suppress reports of deadlocks in a method `m()` use the
`@SuppressLint("DEADLOCK")` annotation, as follows:

```java
  import android.annotation.SuppressLint;

  @SuppressLint("DEADLOCK")
  public void m() {
  ...
  }
```
